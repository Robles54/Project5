# Project #5 Client
This directory has the following starter files. See complete instructions on Canvas.
## SceneManager.java
SceneManager.java is the same as in Project #4.
## DemoScene.java
DemoScene.java is provided to show the syntax for the new classes. It can be compiled with Store.java to check for correct method names and parameters. It should compile without errors. It is *not* intended to be executed.
